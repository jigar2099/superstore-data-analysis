# superstore-data-analysis
Here I have used Tableau and python for data analysis of superstore dataset downloaded from Tableau public.

## Python data analysis
In python especially pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries are used for data anaylsis.
1. First connection between Total sales, Average profit and Average discount are checked.

2. Then in from multiple plots, relation of all four, sales, profit, discount and quantity, with category and sub-category are plotted.

3. Relation between profit and region is obtained and compared for all four years using box plot.

## Tableau data analysis
From Tableau, a dashboard is created which represents sales throughout the year,category sales statewise profit and 
analysis of two most populer items from sub-category.
